# Basic Code Challenge App, not a lot of bells and whistles

Larger resolutions will get a standard layout:

Narrower widths will get an alternative layout:

# Improvements can still be made:
* Tests
* Dockerizing Production Image
* Additional Style Tweaks

# Running the application is relatively simple assuming the following:
* Repository is cloned locally
* NPM, Node, and Yarn are installed locally

# To Run
1: Run the command `yarn` from a terminal in the repository folder (installs dependencies)
2: Run `yarn start`
